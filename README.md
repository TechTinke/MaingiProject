Akan Name Generator

Author: OSCAR MAINGI SOMBA

Description  
The Akan Name Generator is a simple web application that determines a user's Akan name based on their birth date and gender. Akan names originate from Ghanaian culture, where children are named according to the day of the week they were born.

This application calculates the day of birth and assigns the corresponding Akan name for both males and females based on the traditional Ghanaian naming system.

How It Works
Naming System Based on Birth Days
The app determines the day of the week the user was born using this formula:

Day of the week (d) = ( ( (CC/4) - 2*CC-1) + ((5*YY/4) ) + ((26\*(MM+1)/10)) + DD ) mod 7
Where:

CC â†’ Century of birth (e.g., 19 for 1989)
YY â†’ Last two digits of the year (e.g., 89 for 1989)
MM â†’ Month of birth
DD â†’ Day of birth
mod 7 â†’ Finds the remainder when divided by 7
